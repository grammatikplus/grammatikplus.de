# Substantive (Nouns)

Welcome to your first German grammar lesson\! In this lesson, we will learn about **nouns** (Substantive), which are the names of people, animals, things, or concepts.

## What is a Noun?

A noun is a word that represents a person, an animal, a thing, or a concept.

For example:

- **der Mann** (the man)
- **die Katze** (the cat)
- **das Buch** (the book)
- **die Freiheit** (freedom)

### Noun Gender

All German nouns have a **gender**:

- **der** → masculine (male)
- **die** → feminine (female)
- **das** → neuter (neutral)

For example:

- **der Hund** (the dog)
- **die Frau** (the woman)
- **das Auto** (the car)

The gender of a noun is often arbitrary and must be memorized.

### Plural Forms

Nouns also have plural forms, which are not always predictable.

For example:

- **der Tisch** → **die Tische** (the table → the tables)
- **die Blume** → **die Blumen** (the flower → the flowers)
- **das Buch** → **die Bücher** (the book → the books)

### Nouns in Sentences

Let's see how nouns work in sentences.

- **Der Hund** schläft. (The dog is sleeping.)
- **Die Frau** liest ein Buch. (The woman is reading a book.)
- **Das Auto** ist schnell. (The car is fast.)

Notice how the article (**der**, **die**, **das**) changes depending on the noun's gender.
