# Lesson 1: Nouns (Substantive)

Welcome to your first German grammar lesson! In this lesson, we will learn about nouns, which are the names of people, animals, things, or concepts.

A noun is a word that represents a person, an animal, a thing, or a concept.
Examples:

- der Mann (the man)
- die Katze (the cat)
- das Buch (the book)
- die Freiheit (freedom)

All German nouns have a gender:

- der → masculine (male)
- die → feminine (female)
- das → neuter (neutral)

Examples:
der Hund (the dog)
die Frau (the woman)
das Auto (the car)

The gender of a noun is arbitrary and must be memorized.

Nouns also have plural forms, which are not always predictable.
Examples:
der Tisch → die Tische (the table → the tables)
die Blume → die Blumen (the flower → the flowers)
das Buch → die Bücher (the book → the books)

Example sentences:
Der Hund schläft. (The dog is sleeping.)
Die Frau liest ein Buch. (The woman is reading a book.)
Das Auto ist schnell. (The car is fast.)

Notice how the article (der/die/das) changes depending on the noun's gender.

Practice: Fill in the blanks with the correct German article:

1. \_\_\_ Hund spielt im Garten.
2. \_\_\_ Katze schläft auf dem Sofa.
3. Ich habe \_\_\_ Buch gelesen.

Answers:

1. Der
2. Die
3. Das

Next, we will learn about Articles (definite and indefinite), which go hand in hand with nouns in German sentences.
