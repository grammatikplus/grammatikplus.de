## 🗣️ Why German Grammar?

German grammar may seem difficult at first because of features like:

- **Three genders**: _der, die, das_
- **Four cases**: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive
- **Verb placement rules**: the verb is usually in the second position

But don’t worry! By learning step by step, you will see the patterns and start to understand how sentences are built.
